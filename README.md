drivecopy
=========

Fork of the original Google Apps Script to copy folders in Google Drive created by metricube.

## Motive
There is a limitation in Google Drive where you can't transfer ownership between
a Google Account and a Google Apps Accounts.   This script was created to facilitate
copying of a directory tree.

## Installation
The script can be installed by going to http://script.google.com and copying the script.gs file

## Usage
1. Make sure the source folder is shared so that the target Google Drive account has access to the files
2.  In the target Google drive account - click on the folder to be copied
3.  Take note of folder id - it is part of the URL:
 - URL:   https://drive.google.com/#folders/0Bx-GtYAcYz3nRVhyX0RoV1jsT2s
 - Folder id:  0Bx-GtYAcYz3nRVhyX0RoV1jsT2s
4. Open the script link 
5. Copy the folder id into the script text box and click copy
